# FocalLengthPlot
Simple script to recursively search all images in a directory and plot out the focal length of all photos

# ---------------------------------------------
# Average Focal Length Calculator
# This script will recursively search all folders in the current directory
# and pull their exif data to determine the focal length (if reported) for the image.
# This is a simple way to determine which lens or zoom length you use most!
# 
# NOTE: Does NOT work with raw files, and only tested with JPG files from Fuji cameras.
# To use, run with "python3 average_focal.py" from the directory with all your photos.
# Must have matplotlib for Python installed. You can install with pip3, should be "pip3 install matplotlib"
